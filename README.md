# InstantMBTA
InstantMBTA is a service for getting the latest MBTA schedules and alerts and displaying them on a Raspberry Pi [Inky pHAT](https://github.com/pimoroni/inky).

This project retrieves the latest train schedules and finds the latest predicted time for inbound and outbound trains, leveraging the [MBTA API](https://github.com/mbta/api).

The date & time, along with other useful information are then displayed on the inky pHAT.
